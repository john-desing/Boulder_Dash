# JPU-BlankProject

Base de démarrage pour le projet Jave/POO/UML des 1ières années Exia-Cesi

Hello and welcome into the Groupe 11 GitHub with its own version of BoulderDash !
I'm here to guide you into the use of our humble code !

First of all, you will have to create a clone of our whole project.

Secondly, you will have to take the sql file and execute it in HeidiSQL or PHPMyadmin in order to create the database needed.

Then, we sent you a file via mail, containing a target.zip, you will have to unzip it into the project file in order to have the different reports we have setupped.

To continue, you will have to open the project as a Maven project, and go inside the view -> src -> java -> view -> ViewPanel and change the PATH to your "sprites" file (It looks as this : "C:\\Users\\mrsyl\\Desktop\\Final_Projet11\\sprites\\"

After that, you can run the program via the main. Whenever you want to change the map, you will have to change a parameter in : 
model -> src -> main -> model -> model 
The parameter to change is : private int ID = 1;
                           
There are 5 maps runnable, juste change the 1 into a number from 1 to 5 !


And this is it ! Thank you very much for reading me and I hope you will have a good time on our game !
